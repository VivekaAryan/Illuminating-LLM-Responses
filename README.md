# Illuminating-LLM-Responses

Leveraged LangChain framework on GPT 3.5 to create high-quality QA downstream task responses on custom documents. Fine-tuned the T5 LLM to generate headlines from responses and employed contextual similarity (cosine) on the embeddings of the T5-generated headline and the document's title to retrieve the document used to generate the response. <br><br> This integrated framework represents a pioneering approach to document-specific QA tasks, showcasing the potential for advanced language models in nuanced information retrieval and synthesis.
