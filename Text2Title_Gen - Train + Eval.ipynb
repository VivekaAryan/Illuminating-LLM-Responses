            " It is clear that the applicant did not file a Notice of Appeal within the time limited for an appeal from Cowdroy J's decision viz by 25 November 2008.\n",
            "Accordingly, the applicant must satisfy the test for leave to file and serve a Notice of Appeal out of time embodied in O 52 r 15(2) of the Federal Court Rules .\n",
            "That subsection requires that \" special reasons \" must exist which justify the grant of such leave.\n",
            "In Parker v The Queen [2002] FCAFC 133 , at [6] in the reasons of the Court, a Full Court of this Court said: In the civil jurisdiction, Wilcox J discussed at some length the matters which, in his opinion, were deserving of consideration when considering an application for leave to extend the time within which to file a notice of appeal: see Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 , a decision under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth).\n",
            "The matters which attracted his Honour's attention were set out at 348-349: applications for an extension of time are not to be granted unless it is proper to do so; the legislated time limits are not to be ignored.\n",
            "The applicant must show an \"acceptable explanation for the delay\"; it must be \"fair and equitable in the circumstances\" to extend time; action taken by the applicant, other than by way of making an application for review, is relevant to the consideration of the question whether an acceptable explanation for the delay has been furnished; any prejudice to the respondent in defending the proceedings that is caused by the delay is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension; however, the mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension; and the merits of the substantial application are to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted.\n",
            "In the same case, their Honours reviewed a number of other authorities which explained the basis upon which the Court will exercise its discretion to extend time for a litigant to appeal from a judgment of a single judge of the Court.\n",
            "Their Honours made clear that the overriding consideration is the interests of justice.\n",
            "The prima facie strength of the proposed appeal needs to be considered.\n",
            "There must also be an acceptable explanation for the delay ( QAAH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 9 at [7] ).\n",
            "Even where special reasons can be identified, the Court has a discretion to grant or refuse to grant the extension of time sought (per Branson J in Howard v Australian Electoral Commission [2000] FCA 1767 at [7] .\n",
            "In Howard [2000] FCA 1767 at [7] , Branson J also said: \n",
            " Factors to be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion include the importance of the question sought to be raised by the proposed appeal, the bona fides of the proposed appeal and the prima facie strength of the proposed ground of appeal ( Jess v Scott at 188).\n",

            " CONSIDERATION \n",
            " The applicant has not complied with O 52 r 15(3) of the Federal Court Rules .\n",
            "The affidavit sworn by him and filed in support of the present application does not address the matters required to be addressed by subrules (3)(c)(i) to (iii) of O 52 r 15.\n",
            "This non-compliance is a matter of substance not merely a matter of form.\n",
            "There are good reasons why the Court needs evidence going to the matters referred to in that subsection.\n",
            "Generally speaking, the Court should insist upon such evidence being tendered at the hearing of applications of this sort.\n",
            "There are suggestions in the affidavit filed by the applicant in support of the present application that, at least from 17 December 2008, he was endeavouring to make an application for leave to file a Notice of Appeal out of time but was having difficulty ascertaining precisely how to do this.\n",
            "It must be remembered that he did not make an appropriate application until the middle of February 2009.\n",
            "The evidence which might support such a conclusion is somewhat scant.\n",
            "In my view, it falls short of what would be required to make good such a contention.\n",
            "As I have already observed there is no explanation or no satisfactory or sufficient explanation for the delay between 25 November 2008 and 14 December 2008.\n",
            "It must also be remembered that the applicant chose to absent himself from Court at 2.15 pm on 4 November 2008 when Cowdroy J delivered his oral judgment.\n",
            "If the applicant had attended Court on that occasion, he would have known then and there that his application had been dismissed by his Honour and would also have been apprised of the reasons given by his Honour for the orders which he then made.\n",
            "The applicant's failure to attend at Court on that occasion contributed to his failure to lodge his Notice of Appeal within time.\n",
            "However, I will assume, for the moment, in favour of the applicant that, at all times since 14 December 2008, he has been genuinely and diligently trying to make application to the Court for leave to file a Notice of Appeal from the judgment of Cowdroy J out of time.\n",
            "He did not, in fact, file the necessary application until 16 February 2009.\n",
            "I will make the assumption to which I have referred in order to give full consideration to the remaining factors referred to in Parker [2002] FCAFC 133 and to the interests of justice in the present case.\n",
            "The delay might not weigh heavily against the applicant in the present case if the applicant were able to persuade me that his appeal had some prospect of success and that, to deny him his right of appeal, would be to cause him serious injustice.\n",
            "For the moment, I will also assume that the delay referred to has been satisfactorily explained or, alternatively, is not of such duration as to weigh heavily in the balance against the grant of the leave sought.\n",
            "I will now consider the strength of the appeal foreshadowed in the draft Notice of Appeal attached to the applicant's affidavit.\n",
            "I have noted at [41], [42] and [46] above the grounds of appeal which I have been able to distil from that draft Notice of Appeal and the additional matters raised by the applicant in oral argument.\n",
            "The first of these grounds involves the contention that his Honour's discretion miscarried when his Honour declined to entertain fully the applicant's application for judicial review.\n",
            "I think that his Honour correctly encapsulated the principles from McGowan [2003] FCA 482 ; 129 FCR 118 and Transport Workers' Union of New South Wales [2008] FCAFC 26 ; 166 FCR 108 and that it was plainly open to his Honour to exercise his discretion in the manner in which he did.\n",
            "Unless it could be established that his Honour applied the wrong principles or invoked the correct principles but applied them in an obviously incorrect way, his Honour's exercise of discretion could not be overturned on appeal.\n",
            "The decision which his Honour made was clearly open to him especially as the gravamen of the applicant's complaint against the respondent concerned the valuation of his assets made by the respondent.\n",
            "This was a matter apt for merits review.\n",
            "His Honour correctly identified the merits review pathways open to the applicant.\n",
            "Further, the approach which his Honour took was advocated to his Honour by the respondent both in the written submissions made on behalf of the respondent to his Honour and in oral submissions made during the hearing which took place before his Honour.\n",
            "Notice of that approach was fairly given to the applicant.\n",
            "For these reasons, in this case, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that he has any prospect of establishing that Cowdroy J committed error of the relevant kind.\n",
            "This ground is hopeless.\n",
            "As to the second ground of appeal (the contention that the decision under review before his Honour had not, in fact, been made by the Secretary of the relevant Department), given the approach which his Honour took to the application before him, his Honour was not called upon to decide this point and did not do so.\n",
            "His Honour was either right or wrong in the approach which he took.\n",
            "At [69] above, I have held that his Honour's decision was based upon a correct appreciation of the relevant principles and would not be disturbed on appeal.\n",
            "A consideration of the point now raised formed no part of his Honour's reasoning.\n",
            "If, contrary to these views, it is necessary to consider this ground of appeal for the purposes of the present application, I will now do so.\n",
            "The relevant decision was made by a delegate of the respondent and not by the respondent personally.\n",
            "As far as I can tell, the applicant tendered no evidence before his Honour that would support a submission that the person who actually made the relevant decision did not have the power to do so.\n",
            "In order for such a contention to have succeeded, the applicant would need to have proven that the relevant decision maker had no authority to make the decision which he or she made.\n",
            "There is no evidence at all to suggest that this was the case.\n",
            "Nor is there any substance in the applicant's contention that the relevant decision had to be made by the respondent personally and, therefore, that the power to make that decision in the present case could not be validly delegated.\n",
            "As to the third ground of appeal (no power in the respondent to investigate the applicant's claim), I do not think that this contention can possibly succeed.\n",
            "Section 192 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 (Cth) gives ample power to the respondent to gather information for the purpose of considering whether a person who has made a claim for a social security payment is or was qualified for the payment.\n",
            "Further, the respondent is required to assess a claim for a social security payment and is not bound to accept such a claim on its face as being valid without investigation.\n",
            "This ground cannot be sustained.\n",
            "As to the fourth ground (the subpoena ground), it is very difficult to understand the applicant's complaint in relation to the subpoena issued by him.\n",
            "The applicant did issue a subpoena to the respondent.\n",
            "Technical objections were taken to it.\n",
            "Nonetheless, at a listing which took place before 4 November 2008, the respondent did his best to produce the documents called for by the subpoena.\n",
            "No further call under the subpoena was made during the hearing before Cowdroy J.\n",
            "No application was made to Cowdroy J in respect of the production provided by the respondent in answer to the subpoena.\n",
            "There is no substance in this ground.\n",
            "As to the final ground of appeal (actual bias), I am not prepared to regard that ground as having any substance whatsoever in the absence of some evidence tending to support the various assertions of bias made by the applicant.\n",
            "The assertions which underpin this broad ground of appeal constitute very serious allegations against a judge of this Court.\n",
            "They must be distinctly made and, even at this early stage, must be demonstrated to have some proper basis both in fact and in law.\n",
            "Such allegations ought not be made in a Notice of Appeal or in a draft Notice of Appeal as bare assertions unsupported by any evidence whatsoever.\n",
            "In SCAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 668 , after reviewing a number of relevant authorities, von Doussa J said (at [38]): \n",
            " In my opinion it will be a rare and exceptional case where actual bias can be demonstrated solely from the published reasons for decision.\n",
            "Reasons for decision reflect conclusions reached at the end of the decision making process, and if the decision is against the party complaining, the expression of adverse findings on credit and fact are an inevitable part of the expression of the reasons.\n",
            "The mere fact of adverse findings at the end of the matter give rise to no inference as to the state of mind of the decision maker before and whilst the matter was under consideration, nor of prejudgment of the issues that fell for decision.\n",
            "Even where it is possible to show that the adverse findings or some of them are contrary to the evidence or unreasonable, or that the reasoning process is hopelessly flawed, that without more is unlikely to demonstrate that the decision maker had embarked on the case with a closed mind, not open to persuasion.\n",
            "However, where the party alleging actual bias can point not only to an adverse judgment containing demonstrable error but also to conduct by the decision maker antithetical to that party's interests such as a hostile attitude throughout the hearing ( Sun Zhan Qui at 135 referring to Gooliah v Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (1967) 63 DLR (2d) 224) , or a failure to enquire into and to obtain readily available and important information relating to central matters for determination ( Sun Zhan Qui , and SBAN v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 591 at [26] - [27]) an inference of actual bias by prejudgment might then be more readily drawn.\n",
            "But even then the circumstances are likely to be rare and exceptional that the combination of factors and circumstances will clearly prove actual bias.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            " I well appreciate that I am not presently dealing with an appeal from the judgment of Cowdroy J.\n",
            "I have under consideration the grant of an indulgence to the applicant, ie whether he should be permitted to file a Notice of Appeal out of time.\n",
            "A factor in my consideration of the present application, however, is the strength of the proposed appeal.\n",
            "In my view, in considering that aspect of the matter for the purposes of the present application, if allegations of this nature are to be made, I am entitled and, indeed, obliged, to require much more from the applicant than mere assertions made by him unsupported by any evidentiary material.\n",
            "In an application such as the present application, the Court will require admissible and probative evidence in support of such serious allegations before it will regard those allegations as having any substance at all.\n",
            "The nature and extent of that evidence will depend upon all of the circumstances of the case, including the seriousness of the allegations; the identity of the person against whom they are made; the circumstances in which they are made; and the time at which they are made.\n",
            "There is no evidence before me which would support the allegations of bias sought to be made by the applicant in the present case.\n",
            "In my view, no weight should be given to the bald assertion made by the applicant that his Honour was biased against him.\n",
            "This is particularly so when one of the reasons for this alleged actual bias is said to be racial prejudice.\n",
            "This Court should not permit allegations of that kind to be bandied about unless, even at this early stage, some proper basis for them is established to the satisfaction of the Court.\n",
            "In those circumstances, I do not think that the grounds of appeal foreshadowed in the draft Notice of Appeal have any prospects of success.\n",
            "To allow a Notice of Appeal to be filed in the form of the applicant's draft Notice of Appeal, would be to do no more than to allow unsubstantiated, unsupported and scandalous allegations to be made against a judge of this Court.\n",
            "I am not prepared to give the applicant free rein to conduct litigation in this way.\n",
            "In my view, no \" special reasons \" exist for the grant of leave sought in this case.\n",
            "The delay in filing the Notice of Appeal has not been satisfactorily explained; the requirements of the Rules of Court have been ignored; and there is no substance in the appeal in any event.\n",
            "The interests of justice are served by refusing the leave sought by the applicant.\n",

            "There was also a considerable body of evidence led by the Commission that there were numerous instances of inter-company transactions and loans involving substantial sums of money which were not documented.\n",
            "As I observed in my earlier reasons for judgment on 13 February 2009 when I put in place a number of restraining orders, all the corporate defendants in this proceeding, at relevant times, were controlled, or had involved in their activities, one or both of the first defendant, Mr Clestus Weerappah, and the second defendant, Ms Andrea Hawkins: Australian Securities and Investments Commissions v Weerappah [2009] FCA 164.\n",

            " \"...I am particularly concerned about Ms Hawkins' seeming inability to identify the particular borrowers and lenders involved in a number of transactions which were the subject of evidence by her, and her inability to distinguish which company in the group of companies with which she was involved is entitled to receive, or obliged to pay moneys, or discharge liabilities of other companies in the group.\n",

            "However, those affidavits, particularly in the light of other evidence relied upon by the Commission, still leave significant doubt and concern in my mind as to the credibility of Ms Hawkins' explanation for a number of those financial transactions, particularly those transactions which have not been documented properly or at all.\n",
            "The background to the commencement of this proceeding by the Commission is set out in my earlier reasons for judgment and I do not repeat that background.\n",
            "It should be read in conjunction with these reasons for judgment.\n",
            "I turn to the defendants in respect of which I have already appointed a provisional liquidator.\n",
            "The third defendant, Bennett Street Developments Pty Ltd was not the subject of any submissions although it was represented by counsel.\n",
            "The third defendant is the trustee of the Bennett Street Property Trust.\n",
            "Evidence led by the Commission discloses that although money was obtained from investors in that Trust, the moneys obtained were not deposited with the third defendant.\n",
            "Mr Andrew Price, a Senior Manager with the Commission, has sworn affidavits in which he sets out a number of matters which raise serious issues as to that the third defendant and Mr Weerappah may have misled investors in the Bennett Street Property Trust, that they failed to deal properly with the funds of unit holders in the Bennett Street Property Trust and that they may have misappropriated those funds.\n",
            "There is also material which demonstrates that the third defendant has failed to maintain properly or at all, appropriate financial and banking records.\n",
            "In those circumstances, I considered it necessary and appropriate that a provisional liquidator be appointed of the third defendant for the purpose of enabling an independent person to investigate its activities and records and also to ensure that no further funds of it are dissipated.\n",
            "The fourth defendant, Altitude Property No 1 Pty Ltd (Controller Appointed) did not oppose the appointment of a provisional liquidator.\n",
            "It is the trustee of the Bennett Street Unit Trust which it appears has raised money from the public.\n",
            "There is evidence that Westpac Banking Corporation has recently appointed itself as Controller of the fourth defendant pursuant to a mortgage over a property at 25 Bennett Street, Balwyn.\n",
            "On 2 February 2009 a director of the fourth defendant, Mr Stephen Lewis, sent an email to Mr Weerappah in which he said that there was no funding available to make payments due to Westpac Banking Corporation under the mortgage to it and that the property had to be sold.\n",
            "It would appear that the fourth defendant is insolvent and having regard to the manner in which it received funds from Bennett Street Property Developments Pty Ltd, it is desirable that a provisional liquidator be appointed to it to ensure that its affairs may be properly investigated.\n",
            "The fifth defendant, My Building No 1 Pty Ltd, was represented by counsel who announced that it had no opposition to the Commission's application.\n",
            "It is the registered proprietor of the property situated at 81 Lorimer Street, Port Melbourne.\n",
            "There is evidence that the mortgagee of the property either has repossessed, or is about to repossess, the property on the basis that there is default under the mortgage.\n",
            "There is therefore evidence that the fifth defendant is likely to be insolvent and also that its affairs have not been conducted in a proper manner.\n",
            "For example, on 16 January 2004 Mr Dale Robertson signed an ASIC form lodging a charge granted by the fifth defendant in favour of Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd. Mr Robertson was not a director of the fifth defendant on that date.\n",
            "There is also considerable doubt about a Deed of Release dated 20 November 2003 between Alamanda Property Investments No 2 Pty Ltd (of which Mr Weerappah was the sole director) and the fifth defendant (of which Mr Weerappah was the sole director) whereby Alamanda Property Investments No 2 Pty Ltd forgave a debt owed to it by the fifth defendant of $2,479,235.12.\n",
            "There are a number of problems about this release.\n",
            "Mr Lewis, a director of Altitude Property Limited, said in the course of an examination under s 19 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (\"the ASIC Act\") that the release occurred around 2006.\n",
            "Mr Price's searches of the Commission's records disclose that there was no company named Alamanda Property Investments No 2 Pty Ltd on 20 November 2003 and that that company only came into existence on 15 January 2004.\n",
            "There is also an issue about an event when the fifth defendant drew $1.4 million from a loan secured against the property at 81 Lorimer Street, Port Melbourne to pay Alamanda Property No 2 Pty Ltd in circumstances where it does not appear that that company is entitled to that payment.\n",
            "For all these reasons I considered it desirable and necessary that a provisional liquidator be appointed of the fifth defendant in order that its affairs may be properly investigated by an independent person.\n",
            "The sixth defendant, Altitude Property Limited, did not object to the appointment of a provisional liquidator.\n",
            "The Commission has led a considerable body of evidence which discloses a number of serious issues about the conduct of the affairs of the sixth defendant.\n",
            "It is a public company.\n",
            "It issued a prospectus to the public to subscribe for shares in it on 6 October 2006 which appears to have contained misleading information in relation to the purchase of all the outstanding units in the Darling Street Unit Trust which was on offer.\n",
            "The prospectus stated that that cost would be $1.8 million but it did not disclose that the sixth defendant had already agreed to pay further consideration to Alamanda Property Investments No 2 Pty Ltd. Mr Weerappah, in the course of cross-examination on 11 February 2009, agreed that the sixth defendant agreed to pay Alamanda Property Investments No 2 Pty Ltd incentive payments if the value of the property purchased from it increased and that there was no maximum amount of such incentive payments.\n",
            "Mr Weerappah agreed that there was no reference to the incentive payment agreement in the prospectus which he had signed.\n",
            "He said that he believed that all the material was given to the solicitors but he was \"very shocked\" if the matter of the incentive payments was omitted.\n",
            "According to evidence led by the Commission the last incentive payment of approximately $1.4 million was paid by the sixth defendant in or about July 2008.\n",
            "It appears that that payment was obtained from the drawdown of a loan facility the sixth defendant had with Australian Securities Limited.\n",
            "Two of the three directors of the sixth defendant have given evidence in s 19 of the ASIC Act examinations that they did not authorise or agree to the payment of $1.4 million.\n",
            "It will be recalled that all the shares in My Building No 1 Pty Ltd are owned by the sixth defendant and that My Building No 1 Pty Ltd acts as the trustee of the Darling Street Unit Trust, all of the units of which are owned by the sixth defendant.\n",
            "In the events which occurred the Commission has also led evidence that the books, records and financial accounts of the sixth defendant have a number of inconsistent entries in them which require further investigation.\n",
            "The Commission has obtained a document which appears to be a minute of a meeting of the sixth defendant's directors on 25 November 2008 in which two of the directors express their \"grief and disappointment\" that Mr Weerappah had not made them aware that entities owned and controlled by the sixth defendant were entering into arrangements without their consent or agreement.\n",
            "In a s 19 of the ASIC Act examination Mr Weerappah denied attending that meeting.\n",
            "I was therefore satisfied that it was appropriate and necessary to appoint a provisional liquidator of the sixth defendant in order that an independent person could properly investigate its affairs both in relation to financial and property matters.\n",
            "I consider the eighth defendant, Lewmac Investments Pty Ltd (\"Lewmac\"), and the ninth defendant, Ivory Property Group Pty Ltd, together.\n",
            "The necessity for the appointment of a provisional liquidator of each of these defendants arises out of an apparent transaction entered into on 26 September 2006.\n",
            "The ninth defendant is a trustee company and acts as trustee of the Ivory Property Trust.\n",
            "Members of the public subscribed for units in this Trust.\n",
            "According to Mr Weerappah, the ninth defendant entered into a contract to purchase the property at 107 Riversdale Road, Hawthorn from the eighth defendant on 26 September 2006.\n",
            "The purchase has not been completed and, curiously, caveats were not lodged in respect of the purchase until 28 January 2009, which is more than two years and four months after the agreement was said to have been entered into.\n",
            "The caveats claim an interest on behalf of the ninth defendant pursuant to an agreement dated 26 September 2006.\n",
            "The Commission has obtained a copy of that agreement which does not have any operative provisions.\n",
            "It purports to have been made between the eighth defendant as vendor and the ninth defendant as purchaser.\n",
            "It contains recitals which refer to four other or separate contracts of sale dated 5 July 2006 but after the words \"NOW THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH\" there is no further text.\n",
            "The Commission has also led evidence in relation to another purchase by the ninth defendant of a property from Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd. That purchase remains uncompleted.\n",
            "A caveat was only lodged in relation to it on 28 January 2009 and, again, there is an agreement between Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd and the ninth defendant which contains no operative provisions.\n",
            "Mr Price has produced financial accounts of the ninth defendant which disclose as a current asset, a receivable of $1,538,922 being an unsecured loan to Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd.\n",
            "The Commission contends that this loan was a serious breach of trust by the ninth defendant.\n",
            "Having regard in particular to the property transactions to which I have referred, I considered that it was appropriate and necessary that a provisional liquidator be appointed to each of the eighth and ninth defendants to enable an independent person to investigate the affairs and transactions of each of those companies and if necessary, take preventative steps to protect and preserve any further interests they may have.\n",
            "I turn to the relief sought against the second, seventh and tenth defendants by the Commission.\n",
            "The Commission seeks the appointment of a provisional liquidator of the seventh and tenth defendants for the purpose of: \n",
            "(a) securing the assets of those companies and preserving the status quo pending the final hearing and determination of the winding-up application; and\n",
            " \n",
            " \n",
            "(b) charging an independent expert, an officer of the Court, with the task of investigating those companies' affairs and reporting back to the Court.\n",
            "For the reasons to which I shall refer I am satisfied that both those purposes are made out in relation to the seventh and tenth defendants and that there is a reasonable prospect that a winding-up order will be made in relation to the seventh and tenth defendants at the final hearing on the basis that it is just and equitable to do so and that Elite Wealth Builders Pty Ltd may well be insolvent and particularly if a number of the transactions to which I refer are impugned.\n",
            "The Commission also seeks the continuation of restraining orders against the second defendant, Ms Hawkins, in relation to disposal of assets and applying for a passport or leaving Australia.\n",
            "The Commission seeks the appointment of a provisional liquidator of the seventh defendant and the tenth defendant on the grounds, generally, that they have received funds to which they are not entitled, which funds have arguably been obtained from funds subscribed by investors in various of the entities, trust companies and projects under the previous control of Mr Weerappah or Ms Hawkins and that they have entered into transactions whereby they have received monies to which they are not entitled.\n",
            "The relevant amounts or transactions are as follows.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins received money to which she was not entitled being: \n",
            "(a) $62,000 from Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd; and\n",
            "(b) $10,000 from Altitude Property No 1 Pty Ltd, the fourth defendant.\n",
            "The seventh defendant (\"Retail Treasury\") received $330,000 from Twentieth Green Pty Ltd to which it was not entitled.\n",
            "The tenth defendant (\"Elite Wealth Builders\") received money to which it was not entitled being:\n",
            "(a) $115,000 from Lewmac, the eighth defendant;\n",
            "(b) $33,000 from Alamanda Pty Ltd;\n",
            "(c) $32,000 from Elite Equities Pty Ltd;\n",
            "(d) $267,000 from My Building No 1 Pty Ltd, the fifth defendant; and\n",
            "(e) $35,000 from Elite Equities Pty Ltd.\n",
            " \n",
            " The Commission also contends that Elite Wealth Builders has received, and will continue to receive, money initially payable to Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd by way of trailing commissions as a result of acquiring its business and clients.\n",
            "A Purchase Agreement dated 1 May 2008 has been produced upon which Ms Hawkins and Elite Builders rely but the Commission contends that such document has been backdated and is ineffective.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins has filed affidavits in which she explains how each of these transactions, and the receipt of such funds, arose and contends that Elite Wealth Builders, as well as herself, was entitled to receive those funds and that none of them fall into the category of either funds which belong to, or can be traced as belonging to, or being subscribed by, investors in other companies, trusts or entities.\n",
            "Elite Wealth Builders and Ms Hawkins acknowledge that the amounts referred to by the Commission have in fact been received by them but say that they are entitled to retain those amounts which were not received by them improperly.\n",
            "A significant asset now possessed by Elite Wealth Builders is the right to receive trailing commissions to which Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd had been entitled in the past.\n",
            "The Commission has been conducting an investigation in relation to the activities of the defendants and, in particular, that Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd may have operated an unregistered managed investment scheme.\n",
            "According to the Commission, a number of investors invested money with Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd in circumstances where their funds appear to have been dissipated.\n",
            "As a result of Mr Price's investigations, he believes that Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd and its related companies raised about $20 million from about 200 investors without complying with relevant provisions of the Corporations Act .\n",
            "Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd was placed into liquidation pursuant to a creditor's voluntary winding-up on 16 December 2008.\n",
            "It appears that Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd has substantial liabilities.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins has given evidence that on 1 May 2008 Elite Wealth Builders purchased from Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd its loan book, that is to say its customer list and the rights to the trailing commissions to which Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd had previously been entitled.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins relies upon a Contract of Sale which is dated 1 May 2008.\n",
            "That Contract of Sale provided for a purchase price of $150,000 payable by a deposit of $1,000 on the signing of the contract and the balance to be paid over the ensuing nine months but not to exceed 31 March 2009.\n",
            "Mr Price has been unable to identify from Elite Wealth Builders' bank account records at Westpac Banking Corporation covering the period 14 May 2008 to 14 January 2009 any payments from Elite Wealth Builders to Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd recording the payment of monies payable under the contract.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins has given evidence that $1,000 was paid on the signing of the contract but there is no documentary evidence in support of that statement.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins has produced a \"Quickbooks extract\" which records a number of financial transactions said to have been carried out by Elite Wealth Builders.\n",
            "There is no evidence which verifies the manner in which that Quickbooks extract has been prepared.\n",
            "The Quickbooks extract purports to evidence, or identify money apparently paid to or on behalf of Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd. Ms Hawkins says that it shows that since 1 May 2008 Elite Wealth Builders paid $140,822.93 to Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd \"by way of paying DFS staff, rent, invoices, credit card payments and other expenses over a period of time\".\n",
            "Ms Hawkins says that the payments detailed in the Quickbooks extract are corroborated by entries in Westpac Banking Corporation account statements of Elite Wealth Builders which have been produced by Mr Price.\n",
            "However, the bank statements do not corroborate that a number of the payments were either made for or on behalf of Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd or, more importantly, that any of them are referable to payments made under the Contract of Sale.\n",
            "The Commission now contends that the Contract of Sale was not in fact entered into or dated on 1 May 2008 but was rather backdated to that date around 11 December 2008.\n",
            "As a liquidator of Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd was appointed on 16 December 2008, if the Contract of Sale was only executed within a few days before that date, the backdating will have a significant effect on claims the liquidator may have in relation to the assets of Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd. Mr Price has given evidence that in the course of his investigation he used forensic software to analyse documents relating to Elite Wealth Builders.\n",
            "The use of this software generated reports in relation to documents stored on a hard drive.\n",
            "Mr Price produced a report relating to an email sent on 11 December 2008 from \"Clestus Weerappah\" to \"Ms Liz Clegg\".\n",

            "(f) the Restraint of Trade provision in the Particulars of Sale in the contract is two years and ten kilometres whereas in the Restraint of Trade provision in the signed contract the period is one year and the distance is one kilometre.\n",
            "This comparison of the two documents suggests to me that there is a strong inference that the Contract of Sale dated 1 May 2008 was not in fact dated on that date but that the contract was only finally prepared and engrossed and signed on or shortly after 11 December 2008.\n",
            "Counsel for Ms Hawkins drew my attention to the fact that in the forensic software report relating to the email of 11 December 2008 and its attachment there is stated opposite the words \"last printed\" the words \"Monday, 27 October 2008 3:15:00 PM EST\".\n",
            "Counsel submitted that this entry demonstrated that the contract attached to the email of 11 December 2008 could not have been printed for the first time on that date but had certainly come into existence earlier, for example, on or before 27 October 2008.\n",
            "Counsel for the Commission was unable to explain that entry in relation to the date 27 October 2008.\n",
            "Counsel for Ms Hawkins submitted that the forensic software report was unreliable and could not provide an accurate report as to the date of creation of the Contract of Sale as it could not both be created in December 2008 and last printed in October 2008.\n",
            "I am not able to make a final determination as to whether the document upon which Ms Hawkins relies dated 1 May 2008 is genuine or has been backdated or is capable of being set aside by the liquidator of Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd or as to what the reference to 27 October 2008 on the forensic software report means.\n",
            "One explanation for that date may be that the document attached to the 11 December 2008 email was last saved on that date but had earlier been printed on the last previous occasion on 27 October 2008.\n",
            "Even if I assume that the document had been printed on 27 October 2008 so that it did not come into existence for the first time on 11 December 2008, that still leaves open the inference that the Contract of Sale dated 1 May 2008 was in fact backdated because there was a draft of it in existence, not yet signed and indeed, not finalised as to its text or terms on 27 October 2008.\n",
            "Nevertheless, I consider that in all the circumstances there is a very strong inference that the Contract of Sale dated 1 May 2008 was backdated and only signed and executed within five days or so of a liquidator of Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd being appointed.\n",
            "Certainly the inference I can draw from the email of 11 December 2008 is that Mr Weerappah was asking Ms Clegg to look at the draft contract and to consider whether it was alright for it to be executed.\n",
            "Counsel for Ms Hawkins submitted that there was nothing in relation to the documentation to support the proposition that whatever Ms Clegg was being asked to cast her eye over had anything to do with the contract dated 1 May 2008 as opposed to the draft document being used as \"a template for something else\".\n",
            "I do not consider that the terms of the email of 11 December 2008 are suggesting that the document be used for a template for anything other than the contract for the sale of the business referred to in it.\n",
            "Counsel for Ms Hawkins submitted that there was another inference which was equally open, given the content of the email, which was that the document was being \"bandied around for any number of purposes\".\n",
            "But no particular purpose was advanced by counsel.\n",
            "Counsel for Ms Hawkins submitted that there was evidence that Ms Hawkins or Elite Wealth Builders had made payments to Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd after 1 May 2008 of the order of $143,000 and he posed the question --- why would someone be paying that money pursuant to a contact that had not been executed?\n",
            "There is a short answer to that question which is that the payments upon which Ms Hawkins relies are not identified in the Quickbooks extract as payments made pursuant to, or by reference to, the Contract of Sale dated 1 May 2008.\n",
            "Those payments consist of a considerable number of payments relating to Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd.\n",
            "But they are not stated to be referable to, or payments in relation to, the contract dated 1 May 2008.\n",
            "I have already referred, in par [31] of my earlier reasons for judgment, to Ms Hawkins' inability to distinguish which company in the group of companies with which she was involved, is entitled to receive, or obliged to pay moneys, or discharge liabilities of other companies in the group.\n",
            "I am not satisfied that the amount of $140,822.93 shown in the Quickbooks extract upon which Ms Hawkins relies relates to moneys which at the time they were disbursed by Elite Wealth Builders were in reduction of, or were intended to be in reduction of, any amount payable as the purchase price under a contract of sale for the purchase of a business from Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd.\n",
            "If those payments were so intended by Ms Hawkins or Elite Wealth Builders, why would the Quickbooks extract show a payment of $15,729.90 on 21 August 2008 in relation to Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd recorded as \"Loan Dollarforce (to cover wages)\"?\n",
            "Why would the extract show a payment of $824.25 on 25 August 2008 recorded as \"Loan Dollarforce --- Telemarketing\"?\n",
            "I make similar observations in relation to the amounts of $6,087.15 on 16 October 2008 recorded as \"Loan Dollarforce --- Payment of DFS wages\", $2,202.00 on 20 October 2008 recorded as \"Loan --- DFS Sam Pays\" and $271.04 on 1 December 2008 recorded as \"Loan DFS - Corp Executive Office CEO\".\n",
            "The description of these payments as \"Loans to Dollarforce\" is quite inconsistent with Ms Hawkins' proposition that the component amounts of the $140,822.93 were in fact, or were intended to be, payments in reduction of an amount owing to Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd by Elite Wealth Builders under the contract of sale of Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd's business.\n",
            "The issues relating to the Contract of Sale are such that the benefits and the receipt of trailing commissions to which Elite Wealth Builders claims to be entitled, and which will continue to be paid should be under the control of an independent person until the Commission concludes its investigation and its application to wind-up Elite Wealth Builders is determined.\n",
            "It is important that those benefits and commissions not be dissipated and that they should be preserved and controlled by an independent person, someone other than Ms Hawkins whose track record in relation to the management of companies and the manner in which they enter into, and record, significant financial transactions is less than satisfactory.\n",
            "For that reason alone it is appropriate and necessary, consistently with the principles and authorities to which I have referred, to appoint a provisional liquidator of Elite Wealth Builders.\n",
            "I appreciate that such an appointment is a drastic step and that it will be a most significant intrusion into Elite Wealth Builders' commercial affairs.\n",
            "Nevertheless, I have weighed those considerations with the nature and consequences of the financial transactions to which I have referred in these reasons, with which Ms Hawkins has been involved.\n",
            "I am satisfied that the public interest and the necessity to protect the interests of investors in the companies controlled by Mr Weerappah and Ms Hawkins requires that control of Elite Wealth Builders be taken out of the hands of Ms Hawkins and placed in the hands of an independent person.\n",
            "According to Mr Price's investigations Elite Wealth Builders received the sum of $267,000 from My Building No 1 Pty Ltd, the fifth defendant, between 18 July 2008 and 28 August 2008.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins said that according to Elite Wealth Builders' Quickbooks books of account the amount received was $263,188.58.\n",
            "For present purposes, the difference between the two amounts is of no consequence.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins contends that she lent $200,000 to My Building No 1 Pty Ltd on 28 March 2006.\n",
            "She also contends that the amount of $263,188.58 was repayment of that loan together with interest.\n",
            "As with many of the transactions under consideration in this proceeding these financial transactions are not documented or corroborated in any way.\n",
            "There is evidence that $200,000 was deposited into the account of My Building No 1 Pty Ltd with Westpac Banking Corporation on 28 March 2006 but there is no documentation which records the source of that deposit.\n",
            "The Quickbooks extract relied upon by Ms Hawkins is dated 15 February 2009.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins has not produced any record of the initial making of the loan of $200,000 or of the terms of the loan.\n",
            "There is therefore considerable doubt as to whether Elite Wealth Builders is entitled to retain this amount.\n",
            "I therefore consider that this is another transaction which needs to be investigated by an independent person to determine whether the amount of $263,188.58 is the subject of a claim by My Building No 1 Pty Ltd.\n",
            "The desirability of preserving the assets of Elite Wealth Builders to ensure that they are not dissipated if such a claim is made is another reason to appoint a provisional liquidator of Elite Wealth Builders.\n",
            "Elite Wealth Builders received amounts totalling $115,000 from Lewmac on 12 and 17 June 2008, 10 July 2008 and 4 September 2008.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins contends that the amounts totalling $115,000 were received by Elite Wealth Builders in part satisfaction of an amount due in respect of a debt due by it to Mr Weerappah who assigned the debt to Ms Hawkins.\n",
            "This financial transaction, again not corroborated or documented in any way is said by Ms Hawkins to arise out of the development of a property at 107 Riversdale Road, Hawthorn by Lewmac.\n",
            "According to Ms Hawkins the following events occurred.\n",
            "Lewmac was using BuildRite Developments Pty Ltd (\"BuildRite\") to develop a property.\n",
            "BuildRite became financially unstable and Mr Weerappah borrowed $1 million of which he directed that the lender disburse $600,000 directly to BuildRite.\n",
            "Mr Weerappah made that payment on behalf of Lewmac in order to ensure that BuildRite completed the construction of the property at 107 Riversdale Road, Hawthorn.\n",
            "At this point a debt of $600,000 was owed to Mr Weerappah by Lewmac.\n",
            "Mr Weerappah assigned this debt to Ms Hawkins and she instructed Lewmac to pay the money to Elite Wealth Builders.\n",
            "No documentation has been produced by Mr Weerappah or Ms Hawkins in relation to the terms of the payment of the $600,000 or the assignment of the debt or the instruction to pay the money to Elite Wealth Builders.\n",
            "Mr Weerappah said that BuildRite approached him as a director of Lewmac and indicated it had underquoted on the contract for the construction of the property at 107 Riversdale Road, Hawthorn and that it would be unable to complete the development without an increase in the contract price.\n",
            "Mr Weerappah agreed to increase the amount payable to BuildRite by $600,000.\n",
            "No documentation was produced by Mr Weerappah in relation to this transaction.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins' explanation and Mr Weerappah's explanation for the payment by Lewmac to BuildRite is contradicted by Mr Robert Walpole, a Director of BuildRite, now in liquidation.\n",
            "According to Mr Walpole, in 2006 Mr Weerappah expressed an interest in investing in BuildRite and Legal Entity Developments Pty Ltd, another development company of which Mr Walpole and Mr David Hanna were directors.\n",
            "Mr Walpole and Mr Hanna discussed with Mr Weerappah an investment of $1.2 million.\n",
            "As a result of those discussions documentation was prepared to document the investment.\n",
            "The initial agreement was that Mr Weerappah's interests would purchase a one third interest in Mr Walpole's companies and business for $1.2 million.\n",
            "Mr Weerappah transferred $600,000 to BuildRite.\n",
            "Mr Walpole disputes what Mr Weerappah says was the reason for the payment of the $600,000.\n",
            "He says that the $600,000 was part payment of the $1.2 million that Mr Weerappah had agreed to pay for a 25% share in BuildRite and a 33% share in Legal Entity Developments Pty Ltd. (The amount of the interests agreed to be purchased apparently changed.\n",
            ") In April 2007 BuildRite received a further $200,000 from Mr Weerappah.\n",
            "BuildRite received a total of $2,261,513 from Lewmac in relation to the construction of the development.\n",
            "Mr Walpole's evidence is corroborated (and Mr Weerappah's and Ms Hawkins' evidence is contradicted) by an email sent by Mr Weerappah to Mr Hanna at 8:52am on Monday 22 January 2007 which stated: \n",
            " \"Hi David, \n",
            " Over the weekend we discussed the balance of the funding proposal.\n",
            "As agreed there was a price of $1.2million to be paid to gain a share of the following entities: \n",
            "\n",
            " \n",
            " Buildrite Developments --- 25% \n",
            " Legal Entity --- 33% \n",
            " The first tranche of funds is to be paid this week and the balance on completion of the funding proposal through the NAB.\n",
            "...\" \n",
            "\n",
            " I am not able on this interlocutory application in the absence of cross-examination of relevant witnesses to determine finally the evidence which I should accept and the evidence which I should reject in relation to this transaction involving the payment of $600,000 by Mr Weerappah to BuildRite.\n",
            "Nevertheless, there is a strong case made out, based on Mr Walpole's evidence and the email dated 22 January 2007 that the $115,000 Elite Wealth Builders received from Lewmac is recoverable by it from Elite Wealth Builders.\n",
            "There is also considerable doubt that there was any proper or effective assignment by Mr Weerappah to Ms Hawkins in respect of what he says is a debt due to him by Lewmac, if in fact that debt existed.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins produced a Quickbooks account extract for Lewmac as at 24 February 2009 which she says records that Lewmac owes her $635,979.41 which she contends is the outstanding part of the $600,000 paid by Mr Weerappah to BuildRite plus interest.\n",
            "Ms Kohary, a Financial Investigator in the financial accounting practice of the Commission, who has sworn affidavits in which she analyses records of the defendants obtained by the Commission, has examined the books and records of Lewmac including its general ledgers as at 30 June 2007, 30 June 2008 and 31 December 2008.\n",
            "Ms Kohary says there is no loan account in the general ledgers for Ms Hawkins, that is to say, there is no debt recorded in the general ledgers as being owed to Lewmac by Ms Hawkins.\n",
            "The characteristics of this transaction are such that it provides a further reason why a provisional liquidator should be appointed to Elite Wealth Builders in order to ensure that an independent person can investigate this and the other transactions and ensure that the assets and funds presently held by Elite Wealth Builders are not dissipated whilst this investigation is undertaken.\n",
            "I turn to the submission of the Commission that Retail Treasury, the seventh defendant, received $330,000 from Twentieth Green Pty Ltd to which it was not entitled.\n",
            "Retail Treasury was previously owned by Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd and controlled by Mr Weerappah as its sole director.\n",
            "It appears that Retail Treasury owns units in the Twentieth Green Unit Trust and the Rose Anna Unit Trust which have valuable assets.\n",
            "Mr Ross Booth was engaged by Mr Weerappah in or about August 2008 and companies controlled by him to reconcile and put in order the financial accounts of the various entities which Mr Weerappah controlled.\n",
            "Mr Booth said that during one of his meetings with Mr Weerappah on or about 2 and 3 September 2008, Mr Weerappah told him that Retail Treasury was due to receive $1.2 million in the current financial year.\n",
            "The evidence is inconsistent as to the circumstances in which Ms Hawkins acquired the shares in, and control of, Retail Treasury.\n",
            "In the course of a s 19 of the ASIC Act examination on 6 February 2009, Ms Hawkins said that she did not buy the company but took it over from Mr Weerappah because he no longer wanted, or needed, the company and she did.\n",
            "In the course of Mr Weerappah's s 19 of the ASIC Act examination on 6 February 2009, Mr Weerappah said that he had no need for Retail Treasury from a few years ago and that Ms Hawkins was after an entity and \"we transferred it across at the time\".\n",
            "Mr Weerappah said that he did not believe that there was any consideration paid by Ms Hawkins for Retail Treasury.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins, in an affidavit sworn on 24 February 2009, said that when she said in the s 19 of the ASIC Act examination that she did not purchase Retail Treasury, she was referring to the period of time, that is, 2006.\n",
            "Even if I accept this explanation for her answer in the examination on 6 February 2009, it still remains that she said that she took over Retail Treasury from Mr Weerappah without saying that she paid for it.\n",
            "In her affidavit sworn on 24 February 2009, Ms Hawkins responded to a number of the issues and evidence raised by the Commission.\n",
            "In relation to her purchase of Retail Treasury she said the following.\n",
            "Mr Weerappah borrowed $1 million from Traditional Values Management Limited (pursuant to a Loan Facility Agreement dated 25 January 2007).\n",
            "Mr Weerappah used $600,000 of that loan to pay a debt owed to BuildRite by Lewmac (this characterisation of the payment is contested by the Commission) and agreed to lend Ms Hawkins the remaining $400,000 so that she could purchase Retail Treasury from Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd. On 25 January 2007, $375,000 was deposited into Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd's bank account.\n",
            "At the time Mr Weerappah and Ms Hawkins agreed that he would lend her $400,000, she had expressed an interest in purchasing all the shares in Retail Treasury from Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd. She believed the value of those shares to be between $300,000 and $400,000.\n",
            "Eventually they settled on a figure of $330,000 for the purchase of all the issued shares in Retail Treasury from Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd. Ms Hawkins then said \"the purchase price of $330,000 had already been (more than) deposited into the account of DFS by way of the $375,000 obtained from TVM\".\n",
            "None of these financial transactions referred to, and relied upon, by Ms Hawkins are documented in any way.\n",
            "In relevant material respects Ms Hawkins' evidence is not corroborated and, indeed, is inconsistent in relation to her purchase of the shares in Retail Treasury.\n",
            "Her evidence in the s 19 of the ASIC Act examination (and also Mr Weerappah's evidence in the s 19 of the ASIC Act examination) is quite inconsistent with her paying $330,000 for the purchase of the shares in Retail Treasury.\n",
            "At this point of time I am not prepared to accept Ms Hawkins' uncorroborated and undocumented evidence in relation to the financial transactions she relies upon in relation to the purchase of the shares in Retail Treasury.\n",
            "Again, I refer to her inability to identify the manner in which particular payments have been made to, for or on behalf of, or by various companies in the group of defendants with which she was involved with Mr Weerappah.\n",
            "There is therefore a significant issue to be determined, namely whether Ms Hawkins is entitled to be the owner of the shares in Retail Treasury and the identity of the person entitled to the benefit of the assets held by it in the two trusts.\n",
            "In these circumstances, I consider that it is appropriate and necessary that an independent person be appointed to investigate this issue and that steps be taken to ensure that the assets of Retail Treasury are not dissipated.\n",
            "Accordingly, I consider it appropriate to appoint a provisional liquidator of Retail Treasury.\n",
            "There is a further issue which, in my view, warrants the appointment of a provisional liquidator to Retail Treasury.\n",
            "Retail Treasury has no bank account and it is therefore, not easy to identify financial transactions which involve moneys coming to and being paid by it.\n",
            "According to the records analysed by Ms Kohary, units in the Twentieth Green Unit Trust and the Rose Anna Unit Trust were purchased by Retail Treasury not from money that came from it but rather from other companies in the Dollarforce group.\n",
            "Ms Kohary has identified that $94,500 for that purchase came from Ivory Property Group Pty Ltd, the ninth defendant.\n",
            "As that company was a trustee company it was not open to it to use its funds in this way.\n",
            "I should also point out that even if Ms Hawkins did pay Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd $330,000 to acquire the shares in Retail Treasury and accordingly acquire the benefits of the two unit trusts held by that company, the commerciality and justification for the amount of that payment is in question.\n",
            "The relationship between Mr Weerappah and Ms Hawkins was such that the transaction was not an arms length transaction.\n",
            "The consideration of $330,000 appears to be totally inadequate.\n",
            "For example, in April 2008 amounts totalling $330,000 were deposited into the Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd's bank account and in January 2009, amounts totalling $360,000 were deposited into Elite Wealth Builders' bank account.\n",
            "The consequence is that the liquidator of Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd may be able to set aside that transaction on the basis that Mr Weerappah entered into that transaction as a director of Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd in breach of his duty to Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd and that Ms Hawkins was privy to and part of that breach of duty.\n",
            "I am satisfied that it is necessary that an independent person be appointed to investigate these transactions involving Retail Treasury and the unit trusts it owns and the payments paid to Elite Wealth Builders to determine whether there has been misappropriation of funds which should properly belong to Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd or other companies or persons.\n",
            "I am also satisfied that a provisional liquidator should be appointed to Retail Treasury to ensure that its assets are not dissipated.\n",
            "The manner in which Ms Hawkins has been involved in the earlier financial transactions of Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd and the other defendants and her explanations for those financial transactions which have not been documented properly or at all, lead me to the conclusion that she should not continue to be in control of Retail Treasury whilst its affairs are being investigated by the Commission and whilst there are live issues as to whether it is in possession or control of funds and assets which properly belong to other persons or which can be traced as belonging to other persons.\n",
            "There are also significant doubts as to whether Ms Hawkins was entitled to receive $62,000 from Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd and $10,000 from Altitude Property No 1 Pty Ltd.\n",
            "There is also significant doubt as to whether Elite Wealth Builders was entitled to receive $33,000 from Alamanda Pty Ltd and $32,000 and $35,000 from Elite Equities Pty Ltd. Ms Hawkins says that Alamanda Pty Ltd entered into a contract with Elite Wealth Builders to provide various services to it including accounting and administration for a number of companies.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins says that the payment of $33,000 relates to an invoice for those services being rendered to Alamanda Pty Ltd. No invoice or document relating to that contract was produced.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins did produce a Quickbooks extract purporting to show the amounts owing by Alamanda Pty Ltd to Elite Wealth Builders.\n",
            "The amount of $30,000 is recorded as \"Start up capital\" and the amount of $3,000 is recorded as \"Loan --- Alama\".\n",
            "Ms Hawkins says that Elite Equities Pty Ltd entered into a contract with Elite Wealth Builders to provide various services for it.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins says that the payment of $32,000 relates to an invoice for those services being rendered to Elite Equities Pty Ltd. No invoice or document relating to that contract was produced.\n",
            "Ms Hawkins produced a Quickbooks extract purporting to show the amounts owing by Elite Equities Pty Ltd to Elite Wealth Builders.\n",
            "The amount of $20,000 is recorded as \"Transfer of F...\" and the amount of $12,000 is recorded as \"Transfer of F...\" It is not necessary, having regard to the findings I have made in relation to the other transactions to analyse these transactions further, other than to say they support the proposition that a provisional liquidator should be appointed to Elite Wealth Builders pending further investigation of the transactions involving Mr Weerappah, Ms Hawkins and Elite Wealth Builders.\n",
            "I therefore propose to make orders appointing a provisional liquidator of Elite Wealth Builders and Retail Treasury and orders restraining Ms Hawkins and Mr Weerappah from applying for passports or leaving the country.\n",
            "I will hear from the parties as to whether I should make any further and, if so, what orders restraining Mr Weerappah and Ms Hawkins from disposing of their assets.\n",

            " (a) the taxable income of $86,088,045 (\"the declared amount\") understated the taxable income for the 1998 year by $82,950,090 (\"the understated amount\") and the amount of $30,991,696.20 is the gross tax on the declared amount; \n",

            "The applicant submitted that the particulars sought go to that matter, and drew a direct link between the language used in s 177C(1) and the particulars sought, being particulars of the events which the respondent alleges would have occurred had the scheme not been entered into.\n",

            " Further reference was made to Bailey v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1977] HCA 11 ; (1977) 136 CLR 214 ( Bailey's Case ), where an application was made for particulars in the context of the predecessor of Part IVA , and the taxpayer requested particulars of the \"arrangement\" upon which the Commissioner's use of s 260 was based, but the Commissioner refused to supply them.\n",
            "It was held that the Supreme Court had power to order the Commissioner to give particulars of the \"arrangement\", and that such particulars should be given in the circumstances.\n",
            "The applicant relied on Bailey's Case , particularly at 230 where Aickin J referred with apparent approval to the decision in Tomlinson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1974) 23 FLR 314 where Jeffrey J concluded \n",
            " that in the exercise of its discretion the court will give paramountcy to the principle that the appellant should have the fullest particulars necessary to him to enable him to appraise the case which he has to disapprove and should have access to documents necessary for the proof by him of this case.\n",

            " Under s 190 the taxpayers bears the onus of showing that the Commissioner's assessment is excessive.\n",
            "Consequently the relevant facts in the appeal include the view of the facts on which the Commissioner has based his assessment, the manner in which he has arrived at his assessment.\n",

            " The respondent accepts that there is a need for the parties to know the case at hand, but says that the parties do know, having regard to the onus of proof and the structure of Part IVA of the ITAA 1936, the nature of the case that has to be met.\n",
            "The respondent says that the applicant fully knows the case.\n",
            "It knows the amount the Commissioner says was not included in the assessable income that would have been or might reasonably be expected to have been included; knows the provisions upon which the Commissioner relies and knows the particular transactions that the Commissioner has referred to.\n",
            "The applicant is aware of what the Commissioner says the relevant scheme was, how that scheme operated to produce a tax benefit, and the amount of the benefit obtained.\n",
            "The respondent contends that the wording of s 177C(1)(a) provides that the alternative postulate is the amount which was not included in the taxpayer's assessable income, and that Sackville J's approach in Lenzo's Case reveals the nature of the exercise to be carried out, relevantly at [125]-[128] and particularly at [128]:\n",
            " \n",
            " The taxpayer can satisfy the onus of showing that he or she has not obtained a tax benefit in connection with a scheme if: \n",
            "\n",
            " he or she would have undertaken or might reasonably be expected to have undertaken a particular activity in lieu of the scheme; and \n",
            " the activity would or might reasonably be expected to have resulted in an allowable deduction of the same kind as the deduction claimed by the taxpayer in consequence of the scheme.\n",
            "The respondent says that, assuming there is a relevant scheme the dominant purpose of which is the avoidance of tax, then the next question is whether the applicant has been able to demonstrate, having regard to the onus of proof, that if those particular transactions constituting the scheme had not been entered into or carried out, that the applicant might reasonably have been expected to have entered intro transactions which would have had a similar tax benefit.\n",
            "The respondent says that the present application for particulars is, effectively, an application for particulars of the applicant's own case.\n",
            "The respondent says that it is for the applicant to identify transactions which it would have or might reasonably have been expected to enter into so that the benefit obtained by those transactions would have been available through something other than a \"scheme\", the dominant purpose of which was to produce a tax benefit.\n",
            "Further, the respondent noted that the decision of the High Court in relation to the challenge to the Commissioner's Part IVA determination was handed down on 31 July 2008: Commissioner of Taxation v Futuris Corporation Limited [2008] HCA 32.\n",
            "On the programming orders that have been made to date in this proceeding, the evidence is filed, save for any responding evidence of the applicant.\n",
            "The matter is set down for hearing in a little over five weeks.\n",
            "The respondent submitted that the proximity to hearing should be a factor considered in the exercise of the discretion whether to order further and better particulars.\n",
            "CONSIDERATION \n",
            " It is a fundamental principle that a party is entitled to be informed about the opponent's case with sufficient clarity and particularity to allow that party a fair opportunity to meet the case: Dare v Pulham [1982] HCA 70 ; (1982) 148 CLR 658 at 664.\n",
            "The object of requiring a party to give particulars is to limit any generality in the pleadings, so as to inform the party's opponent of the nature of the case which that party must meet, and to prevent the opponent from being taken by surprise at the trial.\n",
            "The provision of appropriate particulars also means that unnecessary expense to the parties is avoided either in pre-trial preparation or at the hearing.\n",
            "The Court has power to order the furnishing of further and better particulars, whether pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction, or pursuant to Order 12 rule 5 of the Federal Court Rules .\n",
            "The question is whether in the circumstances that power should be exercised.\n",
            "The issues in the proceeding will be whether the applicant obtained a \"tax benefit\", and if it did, whether it could be concluded that the relevant scheme was entered into or carried out for the dominant purpose of obtaining a tax benefit.\n",
            "In its Response, the respondent has set out in detail at paragraphs 44 to 46 (quoted in full at [6] above) the relevant amount that the Commissioner says was not included in the assessable income that would have been or might reasonably be expected to have been included; the provisions upon which the Commissioner relies; and the particular transactions which the Commissioner says gave rise to the relevant tax benefit.\n",
            "The Commissioner has pleaded the transactions that comprise the relevant scheme; how that scheme operated to produce a tax benefit; and the amount of the benefit obtained.\n",
            "That would indicate that the applicant is sufficiently informed about the Commissioner's case, with sufficient clarity and particularity to meet that case.\n",
            "In my view, the applicant is not entitled to the further and better particulars it seeks in relation to whether a \"tax benefit\" was obtained.\n",
            "The onus is on the applicant to establish that it would have undertaken or might reasonably be expected to have undertaken a particular activity in lieu of the relevant scheme, and that that activity would or might reasonably be expected to have resulted in a tax benefit similar to the tax benefit obtained by the taxpayer in consequence of the scheme.\n",
            "It is not for the respondent to provide particulars as to what the applicant might have done, had it not entered the scheme.\n",
            "It is not within the Commissioner's knowledge.\n",
            "That is matter for the applicant to prove.\n",
            "The applicant submitted that it should be entitled to take the \"rifle\" approach as opposed to the \"shot gun\" approach in relation to the alternative postulate.\n",
            "That is, the applicant should be entitled to know precisely what alternative postulate the Commissioner relies upon to say that the relevant amount of the tax benefit would have been included in the assessable income of the applicant.\n",
            "The applicant submitted that, without the provision of the requested particulars, the applicant would be required to lead evidence, in respect to each and every possible way in which the float could have been structured; whether it would have done it that way; what commercial or other consequences would have occurred if the transaction had been structured in that way; and the reasons why it did not undertake the float in that way.\n",
            "That would, it was submitted, extend the potential scope of the evidence dramatically because the applicant has to anticipate and rebut every alternative postulate which the respondent might, at trial, put forward.\n",
            "I think that submission is misconceived.\n",
            "It would be nonsensical for the Commissioner to \"suggest\" a possible series of transactions that the applicant might have undertaken which might have led to the relevant amount being included in the assessable income, because such suggestion could only be a matter of conjecture and, if disproved, would leave the Court no better informed and having come no further to answer the question of whether Part IVA of the ITAA 1936 applies.\n",
            "It is for the applicant, who bears the onus, to establish the series of transactions or arrangements which, it contends, would have or might reasonably be expected to have been entered into or carried out and which would have or might reasonably be expected to have resulted in the relevant amount being obtained as a tax benefit regardless of the scheme.\n",
            "In addition, as was acknowledged in the course of submissions, it is not enough for the applicant to disprove any alternative postulate put up by the respondent (assuming the scheme is shown to exist as asserted by the respondent).\n",
            "If it is to succeed on its application, it must also adduce evidence which satisfies the Court that it had an alternative postulate which it would have been able to implement and which would have resulted in the same taxable position as if the scheme which (arguendo) has been set aside had remained in place, or which would have resulted in some other taxable position.\n",
            "The fact that the respondent has some idea as to what the alternative postulate of the applicant might be (as its outline of submissions acknowledges) does not advance that task on the part of the applicant.\n",
            "Nor does it expose the applicant to the need for a \"shot gun\" evidentiary approach.\n",
            "The respondent has indicated what its case is, and the applicant has the task of answering it and then establishing (assuming it does not successfully answer it) what alternative postulate was available to it to arrive at the same, or a different, assessable income for the relevant year.\n",
            "I note that this approach was described by Sackville J in Lenzo's Case , and that an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court in that case was refused: Lenzo v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] HCATrans 371 (12 November 2008).\n",
            "In my view, the applicant is not entitled to further and better particulars of the respondent's case which it seeks.\n",
            "In any event, if the applicant were entitled to the sort of particulars that it seeks, the respondent has provided them.\n",
            "It has identified the amount of the tax benefit, and the detailed transactions by which it alleges the tax benefit was obtained.\n",
            "The respondent has provided all the particulars that it could sensibly be expected to provide in relation to the obtaining of a tax benefit.\n",
            "There is a further and independent ground why I would refuse to order further and better particulars in any event.\n",
            "It is that in the exercise of my discretion, I would refuse to do so.\n",
            "The pleadings have closed.\n",
            "Discovery and inspection have taken place to the extent required by the parties.\n",
            "More importantly, the evidence is all filed, save for any responding evidence of the applicant.\n",
            "The evidence of the respondent is thus defined and confined.\n",
            "The applicant from that evidence knows the case it has to meet.\n",
            "It was not argued, by reference to that evidence, that there is some gaping ambiguity which exposes it to the need to significantly increase its evidence in response beyond that which might otherwise have been adduced.\n",
            "I am not, therefore, persuaded in the particular circumstances that, in the interests of a fair and efficient trial, that further and better particulars of the nature sought are necessary.\n",
            "For these reasons, I decline to order that the particulars sought be provided by the respondent.\n",
            "The application is refused.\n",
            "The applicant should pay to the respondent costs of and incidental to the applicant's notice of motion.\n",
